What began in 2016 as a part-time internship at Automotive News has turned into a  career in business journalism, working alongside a global team of reporters and editors. Walsworth initially covered Subaru of America and a handful of exotic and ultraluxury brands. In 2021 he helped build the award-winning coverage of dealership mergers and acquisitions, or buy-sells. His beat was paired with covering auto retail giants Lithia Motors Inc. and Sonic Automotive Inc. in what was a new era of dealership
